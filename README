CMSC388V - Final project

This is a bitcrusher effect plugin that works with all LADSPA compatible interfaces. 

To install, clone the repository and use:

gcc -shared -fPIC -o bitcrusher.so bitcrusher.c -lm
install -m755 bitcrusher.so /usr/lib/ladspa

Special thanks to:
- Steve Harris' LADSPA plugins, whose Decimator has an intuitive sample reduction algorithm.
- My friend Jared for giving me guitar clips to test with
